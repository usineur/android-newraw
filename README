First, many thanks to Gregory Montoir for his original work.

Then, you have to download pelya awesome commandergenius software.
(GIT repo: https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius ).
You need to install Android SDK 2.2, NDK r4b, and "ant" tool.

Now you are ready. Launch following commands:
	cd project/jni/application
	rm src
	place android-newraw GIT in this directory
	ln -s android-newraw src
	cd ../.. && android update project -p .
	cd ..
	sh build.sh

You should also edit AndroidAppSettings.cfg and replace the link
in the AppDataDownloadUrl item with a valid url to a zip archive
to original game files. Archive structure must be:
	en/
	en/bank01
	en/bank02
	...
