To summarize: you have to download pelya awesome GIT repo from https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius,
then install Android SDK 2.2, NDK r4b, and "ant" tool, then you should launch commands:
	cd project/jni/application
    rm src
	place android-newraw GIT in this directory
    ln -s android-newraw src
    cd ../.. && android update project -p .
	cd ..
	sh build.sh

Many thanks also to Gregory Montoir for his original works
